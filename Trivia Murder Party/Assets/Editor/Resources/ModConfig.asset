  title: Trivia Murder Party Pack
  author: Me
  description: "Modules based on the Trivia Murder Party minigames from both packs
    one and two. This pack is incomplete, but more modules will be added eventually.\r\n\r\nWhile
    not included in this pack, and also has no relation to this modpack, for a full
    experience I would highly recommend the TMP Gameplay room at https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2409797804
    made by TheDarkSid3r.\r\n\r\nThe modules included (In chronological order):\r\n\r\nMental
    Math (Math):\r\nSolve simple math equations consecutively. The amount you need
    to answer is based on your progress in the bomb.\r\n\r\nThe Arena (Rock-Paper-Scissors,
    implementation by Blananas2):\r\nDetermine the order of the attack/defend/grab
    minigames and complete all of them perfectly.\r\n\r\nDictation:\r\nWrite down
    the phrase as it's being read out. Submit a specific word once the phrase is done.\r\n\r\nJailbreak
    (Password):\r\nGuess the four letter password in 90 seconds, invalid words will
    not give you any hints.\r\n\r\nDumb Waiters (Implemented by TasThiluna):\r\nChoose
    which elevator you should bunker in, and try to live based on who chose what.\r\n\r\nChalices:\r\nFollow
    a flow chart to determine which chalice you should drink from.\r\n\r\nPixel Art
    (Memory):\r\nRecreate the pattern shown exactly when it was shown for 7 seconds.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\nFollow
    the rules shown correctly, the amount you need to follow corresponds to how much
    time is left on the bomb.\r\n\r\nSkewers:\r\nDetermine the position of five skewers
    based on the colors of gems shown and find a safe spot to hide in. Manual by Vincology.\r\n\r\nWords:\r\nCreate
    valid words from a grid of letters. Longer words score more points.\r\n\r\nScratch-Off
    (Implemented by tandyCake):\r\nPermute dollar signs on a scratch off ticket, potentially
    gambling more money to do fewer stages.\r\n\r\nMind Meld (Implemented by EpicToast):\r\nCorrectly
    choose from a category that no other player chose, with decisions being determined
    by Zener cards.\r\n\r\nMirror (Implemented by TasThiluna):\r\nIdentify the correct
    ghost's handwriting and submit a word depending on the original word.\r\n\r\nPhones
    (Implemented by TasThiluna):\r\nDial a number that no one else has dialed.\r\n\r\nPatterns:\r\nFind
    a sequence of cards in a grid of cards and press them in the correct order.\r\n\r\nManuals
    can be found at https://ktane.timwi.de/ or in the manuals folder of your game.\r\n\r\nIf
    there are any bugs, contact blananas2 on Discord."
